          Chanakya (Sanskrit: चाणक्य Cāṇakya, Tamil: சாணக்கியர்; c. 350-283 BCE)
          was an adviser and a prime minister to Chandragupta Maurya (c. 340-293
          BCE).
          <br />
          Chanakya helped Chandragupta create the Maurya Empire. Chanakya is
          considered a pioneer (someone who explores a new area) in
          economics.<br />
          He wrote about economics a very long time before Ibn Khaldun.

            English- Consider again and again the following: the right time, the

          He is generally called Chanakya (taken from his father's name
          "Chanak")but, in his capacity as author of the <q>Arthaśhāstra</q>, is
          generally referred to as Kautilya derived from his gotra's name
          "KOTIL"(Kautilya means "of Kotil"). He believed in four ways:
          <emp
            >Treating with Equality, Enticement, Punishment or War and Sowing
            disagreement</emp
          >
          The Arthaśhāstra identifies its author by the name Kautilya, except
          for one verse which refers to him by the name Vishnugupta. One of the
          earliest Sanskrit literatures to explicitly identify Chanakya with
          Vishnugupta was Vishnu Sarma's Panchatantra in the 3rd century BC.
